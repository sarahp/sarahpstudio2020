      <h2>WHY I LOVE WHAT I DO</h2>
      <p>
        With a unique background that combines creative storytelling and technical expertise, I bring a fresh perspective to the field of frontend development. Math becoming art and the human experience, is why I got into Web Development in the first place. Hailing from the world of post-production editing, I have honed a meticulous eye for detail and a knack for conveying intricate narratives through engaging visuals. This foundation in visual storytelling translates seamlessly into crafting captivating user experiences that seamlessly cross the gap between complex mathematical algorithms and intuitive interfaces. Beyond my primary role, I am deeply invested in a personal side project that integrates OpenAI with NextJS to create a chore app tailored to meet the unique needs of neurodiverse individuals. This endeavor underscores my commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements and my passion for exploring the limitless possibilities of AI in enhancing user experiences. I&aposm a passionate, dedicated, innovative game-changer that would love to join Gurobi as it uses Math to make the world a better place.
