      <p> 11yrs of Development Experience I started coding way back in 2007, and have gone through a myriad of tools and
        techniques since. This has given me a good intuition on what is worth pursuing, and where there might be
        pitfalls.</p>

        in our shared goals.</p>

        comfortable presenting high concepts in a friendly way, to any size crowd.</p>
