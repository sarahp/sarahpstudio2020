  Strengths
  ======
  11yrs of Development Experience
  I started coding way back in 2007, and have gone through a myriad of tools and techniques since. This has given me a good intuition on what is worth pursuing, and where there might be pitfalls.

  Development is a team effort
  Knowing where to bring in my skills on a project, and how best to support people in our shared goals.

  Presentations & Public speaking are second nature
  Being a Communications major has its perks. I'm comfortable presenting high concepts in a friendly way, to any size crowd.
